If you need to run on different genomes (e.g. mouse) or different reference transcripts, this will
require creating correct input files.

* Needed for 20/20+

  * generating gene features (observed and simulated)
  * generating simulated MAF files

* gene annotations (BED file) 
* gene sequence (FASTA file)
